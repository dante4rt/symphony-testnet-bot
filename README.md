## Description

The **Symphony Testnet Bot** is a script designed to interact with the Symphony testnet. It includes functionalities to claim tokens from a faucet, send transactions, and perform staking operations. The bot can be configured to run these operations once or automatically on a daily basis.

## Features

- **Faucet Claim**: Claim tokens from the Symphony testnet faucet.
